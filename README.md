Hello, I'm Saad Ali.
I recently had a GitHub page called 'saadalicoding,' but unfortunately, I lost access to it due to an unexpected account issue.
As a result, I created a new account. 
I'm now 18 years old, and my coding journey began when I was 14. 
I specialize in Android development and have expertise in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and DroidScript. 
Additionally, I'm proficient in coding with C, C++, Python, and Java, including creating graphical user interfaces in these languages.
One of my notable projects is a Rubik's Cube solver in C++, developed using object-oriented programming principles and without any lib.
I'm well-versed in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.
Thank you for visiting!
